This repository presents a mathematical framework and illustrative computations for closed-form hypergeometric representations of SU(2) 3nj symbols, with particular focus on 12j symbols and a proposed generating functional. The materials emphasize derivations and representative computational checks rather than exhaustive numerical validation across all parameter regimes.

## Mathematical Framework

The project proposes a closed-form hypergeometric representation that aims to cover many SU(2) 3nj recoupling coefficients within a special-function framework. The repository documents derivations and provides representative computational checks. Key points:

- Symbolic derivations are provided for a range of topologies; some edge cases may require additional analysis.
- The framework can offer alternative evaluation approaches for certain symbol classes; users should benchmark against existing libraries for their specific parameter ranges.
- Derivations and proofs are included in the LaTeX source; consult the paper for assumptions and scope.
- Numerical verification is provided for selected cases but is not a comprehensive validation across all spins and couplings.

The website features interactive exposition, downloadable PDF, example code, and links to related work in the SU(2) 3nj series.

## Computational Verification

The repository includes symbolic and numeric scripts intended as reproducibility artifacts for the included examples.

### üîÑ Symbolic Taylor Expansion
**Script**: `symbolic_taylor_expansion.py`
- Generates symbolic series for illustrative cases and inspects coefficients for internal consistency.

### Hypergeometric Correspondence
**Script**: `match_simplest_hypergeometric.py`
- Demonstrates correspondence with known 9j symbol representations for selected parameter choices.

### Numerical Validation
**Primary**: `verify_simple_9j_numeric.py`
- High-precision numeric checks for representative simple cases.

**Extended**: `verify_additional_9j_numeric.py`
- Additional numeric checks across a small set of cases; intended as a starting point for broader validation.

**Output**: Results and verification artifacts are stored in `data/` for the tested examples; these serve as reproducibility artifacts rather than proof of exhaustive correctness across all regimes.

- `su2-node-matrix-elements`: Operator matrix elements for arbitrary-valence nodes

## Mathematical Background

### Core Theory
The universal representation is presented as a hypergeometric-based construction that relates angular-momentum coupling topologies to special-function expressions. See the paper for precise definitions and applicable assumptions.

### Key Considerations
- The generating functional is proposed as a compact formal expression covering many topologies under stated assumptions.
- Derived closed-form expressions are provided for several topologies; additional cases may require extended derivations or boundary data.
- Performance and numerical stability depend on parameter ranges and chosen numerical precision; validate against established implementations for production use.

## Applications

- Quantum mechanics: angular momentum coupling computations (research/analysis use)
- Computational physics: experimental evaluation of evaluation techniques
- Mathematical physics: special-function identities and illustrative examples

## Scope / Validation & Limitations

- **Research-stage framework:** Materials document a theoretical framework and illustrative verifications. Claims about universality are intended as working hypotheses derived in the paper; maintainers and users should verify applicability for new topologies and large-spin regimes.
- **Numerical stability & validation:** Numerical checks included here cover selected examples; reproduce these checks in your environment and extend them for other parameter ranges. Consider using high-precision arithmetic for large spins and cross-validate against established libraries.
- **Uncertainty & reproducibility:** When publishing numeric comparisons, include environment details, numerical precision, random seeds (if any), and input parameter sets under `docs/` or `data/` to support reproducibility.
- **Limitations:** Derivations assume the conditions stated in the paper; edge cases (boundary conditions, degenerate couplings) may require additional analysis or boundary data.
